# AM207 Final Project - Laura R. Zichi and Marc L. Descoteaux
Kinetic Monte Carlo from reaction networks discovered in molecular dynamics simulations

Organization of repository:
- Clustering: process MD trajectory, generating ACE descriptors, and clustering ACE descriptors with DPA
- kMC_analysis: analyze kMC trajectories and constructing relevant figures
- pyemma_msm: generate and validate MSMs 
- spparks: creating spparks input scripts, parsing spparks output files, representative script for running spparks

All output files from the codes are on FAS RC cluster which we can provide the paths to if needed but did not include in the GitHub for space reasons.
